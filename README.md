# ðŸ¤–  Robot framework playground ðŸ¤–

The purpose of this repo is gather some testing exercises I'll be working on,
so I can get familiar with Robot Framework tool.
I'll try to structure this project depending on the exercises complexity as follows:
* Basic
* Intermediate
* Advance

Each one of those will have nested directories with the exercise. Everytime I'll try
to follow the best practices by dividing each project in "Tests", "Results" and "Resources."
